Single-Cycle RV32I CPU (Verilog + Yosys Synthesis)

This repository contains a single-cycle RV32I CPU implemented in Verilog.
The project was built as a solo learning exercise to understand RTL design, RISC-V architecture, and the ASIC synthesis flow using Yosys.

Overview:

Implements the RV32I base instruction set.
Single-cycle datapath for clarity and simplicity.
Modular Verilog design.
Synthesizable and tested.
Synthesis performed using Yosys.
